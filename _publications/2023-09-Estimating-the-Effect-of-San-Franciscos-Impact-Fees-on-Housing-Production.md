excerpt: 'This paper examines the impact of reducing impact fees on housing production, suggesting that a 50% reduction may not significantly increase construction. Analyzing adjacent parcels in San Francisco, the study finds no difference in development probability or expected unit count between parcels subject to different impact fees, highlighting the need for alternative policy solutions to address housing shortages.'
